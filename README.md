<h1> MATH SUMMARY DOCUMENTS </h1>

This repo contains creative summary documents for all the math courses I have studied at Forman Christian College University (FCCU). All of these summaries werre made using LaTeX. 

The courses' details can be found from FCCU's [course catalog](https://www.fccollege.edu.pk/academic-catalogs-and-handbooks/). Alternatively, you can use [EmpowerX](https://empowerx.shinyapps.io/EmpowerX/) which is a service I made in R to help FCCU undergraduate students manage their degree. 

This is just a fun project I am doing to revise my math concepts and practice LaTeX. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions, do let me know.
